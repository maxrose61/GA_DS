***The Beatles vs. The Rolling Stones?***

For a particular generation or two, the statement above defined you. Can data tell us why or answer the age-old question who is better?
<br>
Using the MusicBrainz database, I will examine points such as the number of songs released, number of albumns released and re-released worldwide and user ratings for the releases. I will also measure recording of the band's respective catalog of works as a measure of the quality and popularity of each band's original catalog.
<br>
The MusicBrainz database (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) represents a comprehensive pool of information about recorded music. The two bands I have chosen represent a relatively small subset of this data yet still between them have a large catalog of songs and recordings, with decades of history generating a significant data trail that may provide hidden insights beyond the primary question of "Beatles or Stones"?

The dataset is available via virtual machine [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server/Setup#Accessing_the_database)<br>
which can be queried for the raw data relavant to my project.
